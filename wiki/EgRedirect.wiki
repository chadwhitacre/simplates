=Example 3: Redirecting to Another Page=

This example introduces two things:

  # the 'import' section of a simplate
  # ending a request with `raise SystemExit(response)`

As a contrived example, we will redirect to a login page if the user hits our simplate and is not logged in.


=== settings.py ===

{{{
SIMPLATE_DIRS = (
     '/path/to/simplates',
)
}}}


=== urls.py ===

{{{

from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
from simplates.views import direct_to_simplate


urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^private/file.html$', direct_to_simplate),
)

}}}


=== simplate at /path/to/simplates/private/file.html ===

This simplate has three sections, all separated by this line:

{{{
#<!--===BREAK===-->
}}}

Again, this token is chosen so that it is syntax-highlighted as a comment in your editor whether you are using HTML or Python highlighting (to work efficiently with simplates, you'll want to set up a key mapping in your editor to quickly switch between these highlighting modes).

The first section is only run once, when the simplate is hit for the first time. Use it for doing Python imports and defining constants. The second section is a Django view, and the third section is a Django template. Any objects you define in the first (import) or second (view) sections become part of the context for the third (template) section.

Now let's look at `raise SystemExit`, aka `sys.exit()`. Here's how `SystemExit` behaves from inside a simplate:

  * `raise SystemExit(response)` _skips_ all further processing (returns `response` directly)
  * `raise SystemExit` _proceeds to_ further processing (skips rest of simplate view code)

Here is the content of our simplate for this example:

{{{
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect


#<!--===BREAK===-->

if request.user.is_anonymous():
    raise SystemExit(HttpResponseRedirect('/login/'))


#<!--===BREAK===-->

<p>You must be authenticated to view this.</p>
}}}
